Motif Finder                                 
Introduction  
This Motif Finder which is also a Sequence Analyzer is a versatile tool designed for bioinformatics 
analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. With this tool, users can perform a variety of 
sequence analysis tasks, including identifying sequence type(DNA, RNA or Protein), specific 
sequence elements such as TATA and CCAAT boxes, calculating AT and GC content, searching for 
motif patterns using regular expressions in a given sequence, and predicting the presence of 
promoters in DNA sequences based on TATA and CCAAT motifs and GC content. 
Features and functionalities 

Sequence Analysis Options

The tool offers a menu-driven interface that allows users to select from different sequence analysis 
options, making it easy to perform specific tasks according to the user's requirements. 

1.Sequence Element(TATA/CCAAT Box, AT Content, GC Content) 
TATA box : This option allows users to search for the TATA box motif within DNA sequences. These 
are conserved nucleotide areas seen at close to 25-30 base pairs upstream to the site of 
transcription initiation. Consensus sequence – TATAAA 
CCAAT Box: This option enables users to search for the CCAAT box motif within DNA sequences.  
These are conserved nucleotide areas seen at close to 75-80 base pairs upstream to the site of 
transcription initiation. Consensus sequence – GGCCAAT 
AT Content - Users can calculate the AT content of DNA sequences. AT content refers to the 
proportion of adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases in the DNA sequence relative to the total number of 
bases.  
GC Content - This option allows users to calculate the GC content of DNA sequences. GC content 
represents the proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in the DNA sequence relative to the 
total number of bases.

2.Motif pattern 
The tool employs regular expressions to search for motif patterns within sequences, enabling users 
to identify specific sequence patterns of interest in a given sequence(DNA, RNA or Protein) 

3.Promoter prediction 
For DNA sequences, the tool can predict the presence of promoters by analyzing the arrangement 
of TATA and CCAAT boxes and the GC content within the sequence. 

4.Sequence type  
Identify the type of sequence. It checks the characters present in the sequence against predefined 
alphabets for DNA, RNA, and protein. If the sequence contains characters consistent with one of 
these alphabets, it is classified accordingly.
